## What is this?
This is a fun side project that I am building in my free time (which I dont get much of).

The essense of the app is to helps remind people to 'set aside' and save their money. The app will remind users to set aside a variable amount of money once a week. At the end of 52 weeks, the user will have saved $1000.

Basically this is a app version of this: https://clark.com/personal-finance-credit/save-1000-easy-chart/

## Development plan

I plan to build this app in multiple stages:...
1. Basic app - only supporting "dollars". Work with a designer to build screens.
2. Local notifications including tasts and badges
3. Multi currency support.
4. Additional widgets - eg Today widget/Watch/iMessage/Siri?

Nothing is set in stone. So I may build similar features in parallel. I do plan on over engineering this app for the sake of my own personal development.

## App Flow
My planned flow:...

- When you launch the app the first time - it asks how much you want to save in the next 12 months - default value is $1,000 and the currency.
- On the main app screen - App shows:
 - The amount saved so far
 - The amount saved (or to be saved) this week
 - The amount saved in the past
 - The amount to be saved from next week onwards
 - Action: Mark a week as 'paid'. Happy to pay extra if you can build a Lottie animation for this action.

This default value ($1000) might not make sense for all currencies but I'll worry about it later. If you can please try to do your best to allow the UI to accomodate upto 5 digits (0-99,999)
